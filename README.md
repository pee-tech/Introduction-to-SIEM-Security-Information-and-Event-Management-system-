# Introduction to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

## Overview
This repository documents my completion of the **Introduction to SIEM** room on **TryHackMe**.  
It focuses on how SIEM platforms collect, correlate, and analyse logs to detect security threats and support incident response within a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**.


## Objectives
- Understand what SIEM is and why it is important
- Learn how logs are collected from multiple sources
- Understand the difference between logs, events, and alerts
- Explore how SIEM supports threat detection and incident response
- Gain exposure to SOC workflows and blue team operations


## Key Concepts Learned
- **SIEM**: Centralised platform for log collection, correlation, and alerting
- **Log Sources**: Endpoints, servers, firewalls, applications, and network devices
- **Event Correlation**: Identifying suspicious patterns across multiple log sources
- **Alerts**: Notifications triggered by abnormal or malicious activity
- **SOC Workflow**: Monitoring, investigation, response, and reporting


## Tools & Platforms Used
- TryHackMe
- SIEM simulation environment
- Markdown documentation
